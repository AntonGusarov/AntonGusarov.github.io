I"-<p>Any computational model – no matter if this is the machine learning model or numerical solution of differential equations – must go through the <strong>validation</strong> procedure. It is needed to determine the extent to which model’s outcomes fit the real process and determine the range of validity of the model and its capability to reproduce a physical process of interest with an acceptable accuracy.</p>

<p>This post reviews the most common error measures and metrics, discusses their benefits and limitations. Having a set of error measures at hand, the next step in the development of validation metrics is to use them to evaluate the predictive (descriptive) ability of the model in the presence of <strong>experimental uncertainties</strong>. The Bayesian approach described in can be used for these purposes [2].</p>

<p>In [1], seven properties are proposed validation metrics ideally should have. These properties form a general framework for the development of new metrics depending on the subject area and modeling goals. In particular, any metric must possess the metric properties in the mathematical sense as a measure of the residual: 
\[d(x, y) \geq 0 \]
\[d(x, y)=d(y, x)\]
\[d(x, y)+d(y, z) \geq d(x, z)\]
\[d(x, y)=0 \Leftrightarrow x=y\]</p>
