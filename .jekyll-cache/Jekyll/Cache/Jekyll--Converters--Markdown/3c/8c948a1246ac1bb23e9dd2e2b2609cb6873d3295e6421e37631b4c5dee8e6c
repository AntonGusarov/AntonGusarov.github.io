I"ñ<p>Any computational model â€“ no matter if this is the machine learning model or numerical solution of differential equations â€“ must go through the <strong>validation</strong> procedure. It is needed to determine the extent to which modelâ€™s outcomes fit the real process and determine the range of validity of the model and its capability to reproduce a physical process of interest with an acceptable accuracy. This post reviews the most common error measures and metrics, discusses their benefits and limitations.</p>

<p>In [1], seven properties are proposed validation metrics ideally should have. These properties form a general framework for the development of new metrics depending on the subject area and modeling goals. In particular, any metric must possess the metric properties in the mathematical sense as a measure of the residual: 
\[d(x, y) \geq 0 \]
\[d(x, y)=d(y, x)\]
\[d(x, y)+d(y, z) \geq d(x, z)\]
\[d(x, y)=0 \Leftrightarrow x=y\]</p>
