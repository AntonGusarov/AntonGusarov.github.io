I"A<p>Any computational model – no matter if this is the machine leraning model or numerical solution of differential equations – must go through the <strong>validation</strong> procedure. It is needed to determine the extent to which model’s calculations fit the real situation and determine the limits of the model and its capability to reproduce a physical process of interest with acceptable accuracy.</p>

<p>In particular, any metric must possess the metric properties in the mathematical sense as a measure of the residual: 
\[d(x, y) \geq 0 \]
\[d(x, y)=d(y, x)\]
\[d(x, y)+d(y, z) \geq d(x, z)\]
\[d(x, y)=0 \Leftrightarrow x=y\]</p>
