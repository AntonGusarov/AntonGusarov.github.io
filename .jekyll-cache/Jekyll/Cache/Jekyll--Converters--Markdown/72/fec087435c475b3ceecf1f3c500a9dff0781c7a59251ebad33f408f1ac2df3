I"l!<p>Today consider the common concepts of machine learning: <strong>overfitting</strong> and <strong>underfitting</strong>, its relation to the <strong>model complexity</strong> that are integrated in the <strong>bias-variace tradeoff</strong>. Also, I will provide the <em>full</em> derivation of the bias-varince tradeoff formula which is often ignored in the literature and usually shown reduced just up to the final result.</p>

<p>The first is  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting"><strong>overfitting</strong></a> – phenomenon when the performance on the test dataset is noticeably worse than on the train one. This is the major problem of machine learning: if there was no such an effect i.e. the error on the test almost coincided with the error on the training, then all the training would be just reduced to minimizing the error on the test data (so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_risk_minimization">empirical risk minimization</a>) which doesn’t apparently happen.</p>

<p>The second is  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting"><strong>underfitting</strong></a> – phenomenon where the error in the training sample is excessively large. Such a situation might be explained by the fact that underfitting can be observed  during the training process often when too few iterations of the train algorithm (e.g. back propagation) has been made i.e. “we did not have enough time to learn.”</p>

<p>Third, <strong>model complexity</strong> describes how various is the ensemble of algorithms in the model class in terms of their functional properties (for example, the ability to fit the train samples). Increasing complexity (i.e. employing more complex models) solves the problem of underfitting but causes overfitting.</p>

<p>Now demonstrate how the problem of model complexity choice manifests itself and how overfitting pops up. Let’s consider an exampe of <strong>polynomial regression</strong>. For simplicity, assume that this is a model on a single predictor \(x\). The target \(y\) is known from a finite set of noisy observations. In the figure below is shown the approximations to the target noisy function\(y=f(x)\) by the polynomial regression model of different orders:</p>

<p>It can be seen that the polynomial of the order 1 is clearly not suitable for describing the target dependence – clear <strong>underfitting</strong>. The model of order 2 describes the target function better, although there is a substantial errors on the training sample. With orders 3-5 we have even better fit with still a smooth curve. The extremely flexible model of order 20 doesn’t at all look like a “natural function” and deviates significantly from the target dependence with too <strong>much following the noise in the train data</strong> therefore affecting its validation score – <strong>overfitted model</strong>.</p>

<p>If to plot the MSE performance of a similar polynomial model vs the model complexity, we can notice that with the order increase, the error in the training sample always goes down. While on the test sample it first falls then increases, indicating the optimal point of model complexity where the bias-variance tradeoff is achieved (which is not always the case though).</p>

<h1 id="bias-variance-tradeoff-formula-derivation">Bias-variance tradeoff formula derivation</h1>

<p>Let us now figure out what is going out from the theoretical viewpoint.</p>

<p>Say that exist some true <em>deterministic</em> function that we want to approximate with our ML/DS model
\[
f=f(\mathbf{x})
\]</p>

<p>We cannot observe outcomes of this unknown function directly but with some additive noisy component, say that has \(\operatorname{E} ( \varepsilon ) = 0\).
\[
t = f + \varepsilon
\]</p>

<p>Consider a dataset:
\[
\mathbf{D}=\left[ \left(t_{i}, \mathbf{x}_{i}\right), \ i=1 \ldots N \right]
\]</p>

<p>Having this dataset \(\mathbf{D}\), we train a parametric model \(g\) (e.g. neural network, linear regression, etc.) to approximate the function of interest \(f\) based on the noisy observations \(t\):
\[
y_i=g(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{w})
\]</p>

<p>Assume that MSE is the measure our model quality:
\[
\operatorname{MSE} = E\left[\left(t_i-y_i\right)^{2}\right]
\]</p>

<p>Do some math over this expectation:</p>

<p>\[
E \left[ \left(t_i-y_i\right)^{2} \right] = \text{/add and substract hypothetical true values then associate/} = E\left[\left(\left(t_{i}-f_{i} \right) + \left(f_{i} -y_{i} \right) \right)^{2}\right] 
\]</p>

<p>\[
= E\left[ \left(t_{i}-f_{i}\right)^{2}\right]+E\left[\left(f_{i}-y_{i}\right)^{2} \right]+2 E\left[ \left(f_{i}-y_{i}\right)\left(t_{i}-f_{i}\right)\right] 
\]</p>

<p>\[
= E\left[\varepsilon^{2} \right]+E\left[\left(f_{i}-y_{i}\right)^{2} \right]+2\left(E\left[f_{i} t_{i}\right]-E\left[ f_{i}^{2}\right]-E\left[y_{i} t_{i}\right]+E\left[y_{i} f_{i}\right]\right) = E\left[ \varepsilon^{2} \right]+E\left[\left(f_{i}-y_{i}\right)^{2} \right] + 0
\]</p>

<p>The last term goes to zero because:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>\( E\left[ f_{i} t_{i} \right] = f_i^2 \Leftarrow E\left[ f_{i} (f_{i} + \varepsilon) \right] = E \left[ f_i^2 + f_i\varepsilon \right] = / f_i \ \text{is determenistic} / = E\left[ f_i^2 \right] + 0 = f_i^2; \)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>\( E\left[ y_{i} t_{i} \right] = E\left[y_{i}\left(f_{i}+\varepsilon\right) \right] = E\left[ y_{i} f_{i}+y_{i} \varepsilon\right] = E\left[ y_{i} f_{i} \right] + E\left[ y_{i} \right] E\left[ \varepsilon \right] = E\left[ y_{i} f_{i} \right]. \)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>So now we have
\[
E\left[ \left(t_i-y_i\right)^{2} \right] = \sigma_{\varepsilon}^2 + E\left[ \left( f_{i}-y_{i} \right)^{2} \right]
\]</p>

<p>where we can apply the same trick as before to the second term but adding and subtracting the mean of the model outcomes:
\[
E\left[ \left(f_{i}-y_{i}\right)^{2} \right] = E\left[ \left(f_{i} - \bar{y_{i}}  + \bar{y_{i}} - y_{i}\right)^{2} \right] 
\]</p>

<p>\[
= E\left[ \left(f_{i}-\bar{y_{i}}\right)^{2} \right] + E\left[ \left(\bar{y_{i}}-y_{i}\right)^{2}\right] + 2E\left[ \left(\bar{y_{i}}-y_{i}\right)\left(f_{i}-\bar{y_{i}}\right) \right]
\]</p>

<p>\[
= E\left[ \left(f_{i}-\bar{y_{i}}\right)^{2} \right] + E\left[\left(\bar{y_{i}}-y_{i}\right)^{2} \right] + 2\left(E\left[f_{i} \bar{y_{i}}\right]-E\left[\bar{y_{i}}^{2}\right] - E\left[ y_{i} f_i \right] + E\left[y_{i} \bar{y_{i}}\right]\right)
\]</p>

<p>The last term also cancels to zero because:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>\( E\left[ f_{i} \bar{y_{i}} \right] = / f_i \ \text{is determenistic} / = f_{i}E \left[ \bar{y_{i}} \right] = f_{i} \bar{y_{i}} \)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>\( E\left[ \bar{y_{i}}^{2} \right] = / \text{mean is determenistic} / = \bar{y_{i}}^{2} \)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>\( E\left[ y_{i} f_i \right] = f_i\bar{y_{i}} \)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>\( E\left[ y_{i} \bar{y_{i}}\right] =\bar{y_{i}}^{2} \)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Then, if to sum up we have the following:</p>

<p>\[
\boxed{ \operatorname{MSE} = E\left[ \left(t_i-y_i\right)^{2} \right] = E\left[ \left(f_{i}-\bar{y_{i}}\right)^{2}\right] + E\left[ \left(\bar{y_{i}}-y_{i}\right)^{2}\right] + \sigma^2_\varepsilon}
\]</p>

<p>\[
\boxed{ \operatorname{MSE} = \operatorname{Bias}\left[ y \right] + \operatorname{Var} \left[ y \right] + \sigma_\varepsilon^2 }
\]</p>

<p>Thus to minimize the MSE of the model, we have to minimize both the bias of the model as well its variance although it is not trivial!</p>

<p>The following is commonly true about the components of the bias-variance equation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A high bias model</strong> has a relatively large error, mostly due to <em>wrong assumptions about the data features</em>;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A high variance model</strong> is quite <em>sensitive to small variations in the train data</em>;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Irreducible error</strong> is due to the intrinsic <em>noisiness of the data itself</em>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Some additional notes on the bias-variance tradeoff formula interpretation. The train subset is selected from some distribution of the totally available data. The ML model is also stochastic by its nature since it depends on this subset as well as the algorithm fitting procedure is random itself. Thus, expressions are written for a specific point \(\mathbf{x}_i\)</p>
